# @tka85/dotenvenc

**NOTE**: *This is an improved version of the now deprecated [dotenvenc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenvenc).*

Are you using `.env` and it contains secrets like passwords & tokens?

And are you using [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to expose those secrets as `process.env` variables to your app?

**Problem**: you are exposing the secrets in plain text in your repository and your production system.

**Solution**: you can now save your `.env` encrypted as `.env.enc`, then decrypt it during runtime only in memory (never on disk) and transparently get the same functionality as you enjoyed from `dotenv`.

## Benefits

* Secure!
  ✔ You can safely commit into your codebase the encrypted `.env.enc` without compromosing your secrets
* Secure!!
  ✔ Your secrets exist unencrypted only in memory during runtime; never on disk
* Secure!!!
  ✔ Secrets protected with strong encryption (AES-256)
* Handy!
  ✔ Comes with CLI script `dotenvenc` for easily updating your `.env.enc` from your local (uncommitted) `.env`
* Lean!
  ✔ Still maintain a single dependency but now on `dotenvenc` instead of `dotenv`
* Easy!
  ✔ Transition from `dotenv` replacing a single line of code
* Flexible!
  ✔ Not limited to `.env` and `.env.enc` i.e. you can set any custom filenames for the encrypted and unencrypted files
* Modern!
  ✔ Fully re-written in Typescript

## Tip

Add `.env` in your `.gitignore` so your unencrypted secrets are guaranteed to never get committed in your codebase.

## New feature in v5.2.0

Each time you encrypt your `.env` now you get additionally to the `.env.enc` also a file `.env.enc.readable` (or if you are using a custom env file, the same named with a `.enc.readable` suffix). This file contains the variable names in human readable form, and the values are the HMAC digests of the corresponding `.env` values. Why? So that you can see each time you re-generate the encrypted `.env.enc`, which variables have potentially changed.

### CAUTION

If this `.readable` file is committed to a public repository, it exposes you to the danger that, even though HMAC is a cryptographic hash function which is designed to be difficult to reverse, an attacker might attempt a brute force or dictionary attack and expose your secrets.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @tka85/dotenvenc
```

## Encryption

You have a `.env` (or custom-named unencrypted secrets file) and you will generate a `.env.enc` (or custom-named file) which is encrypted and safe to commit.

You can use the handy command-line script `dotenvenc` that comes installed with the package. Just run it without arguments to see the help page.

### Step 1 (optional)

#### Convenient option

Save the encryption/decryption password you will be using in the environment variable `DOTENVENC_PASS` in your `.bashrc` (or `.bash_profile`):

```bash
export DOTENVENC_PASS='mySuperDuperPassword';
```

and reload it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Upon runtime your app will use this env variable when reading the encrypted `.env.enc` to decrypt it and populate your `process.env` (see following section `Decryption` on how to do this).

But setting this env variable is also helpful for the CLI tool `dotenvenc`. If `DOTENVENC_PASS` is set, the `dotenvenc` script will not prompt you each time to type the password for encryption/decryption.

#### Secure option

For maximum security, do not save the `DOTENVENC_PASS` not even as an environment variable in your `.bashrc`. If it is not set, the application will ask for it upon startup before it can proceed to decrypt `.env.enc` and populate your `process.enc`.

### Step 2: encrypt .env

Note: you will have to repeat this step each time you make changes to a secret in your unencrypted `.env` and need to reflect it into the encrypted `.env.enc`.

If your unencrypted secrets file is `.env` and resides at the root of the project, then simply:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -e
```

will prompt you (x2) for an encryption password (unless `DOTENVENC_PASS` is set) and proceed to generate an encrypted secrets file `.env.enc`.

And if your unencrypted secrets file is not named the default `.env`, we have you covered:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -e -i /path/to/my/secrets-env-filename
```

will prompt you (x2) for an encryption password (unless `DOTENVENC_PASS` is set) and proceed to generate an encrypted secrets file `.env.enc`.

And if you don't want to name the encrypted secrets file `.env.enc`, we also have you covered:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -e -i /path/to/my/secrets-env-filename -o /another/place/to/my/encrypted-secrets-env-filename
```

will prompt you (x2) for an encryption password (unless `DOTENVENC_PASS` is set) and proceed to generate an encrypted secrets file `/another/place/to/my/encrypted-secrets-env-filename`.

## Decryption

Let's assume the contents of the `.env` that you encrypted into `.env.enc` are:

```text
DB_PASS='superDuperPassword'
SECRET_TOKEN='noMoreSecrets'
```

For all possible decryption scenarios that follow, the principle is:

* If you have set env var `DOTENVENC_PASS`, no additional step is needed
* If you have not set env var `DOTENVENC_PASS`, you will be prompted to supply the decryption password before proceeding
  
You can now populate the `process.env` in your app's code as follows:

```javascript
require('dotenvenc').decrypt();
// From here on your app will have access to the secrets through `process.env.DB_PASS` and `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN`
```

or in ES6:

```ES6
import { decrypt } from 'dotenvenc';
decrypt();
// From here on your app will have access to the secrets through `process.env.DB_PASS` and `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN`
```

If you used a custom encrypted filename:

```javascript
require('dotenvenc').decrypt({ encryptedFile: './somewhere/.secrets.custom.enc'});
// From here on your app will have access to the secrets through `process.env.DB_PASS` and `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN`
```

or in ES6:

```javascript
import { decrypt } from 'dotenvenc';
decrypt({ encryptedFile: './somewhere/.secrets.custom.enc'});
// From here on your app will have access to the secrets through `process.env.DB_PASS` and `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN`
```

## Recovery of unencrypted secrets file

You want to decrypt and view the contents of your encrypted secrets file?
A new team member wants to recreate the `.env` upon checkout of the project? (remember that `.env` is an unversioned file)
Or you want to recreate the `.env` because it got lost or corrupted?

You can use the same handy command-line `dotenvenc` you used to initially encrypt your unencrypted `.env` secrets file.

Using the script's `-d` flag:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -d
```

or if you used custom name instead of the default `.env.enc`:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -d -i ./somewhere/.secrets.custom.enc
```

In both cases you will be prompted to provide the password that was used to create the encrypted file (if `DOTENVENC_PASS` is not set) and, assuming the password is correct, you will have the contents printed on the screen in the format:

```
VAR1=VALUE1
VAR2=VALUE2
...
```

## Bonus

You can dump the contents of your encrypted secrets file as shell `export` statements.

Using the script's `-x` flag:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -x -i ./somewhere/.secrets.custom.enc
```

This will print on console:

```
export VAR1=VALUE1;
export VAR2=VALUE2;
```

### How is that useful?

Using the shell's `eval` in a shell script you can populate your environment dynamically without ever storing the sensitive information on disk.

```
eval `./node_modules/.bin/dotenvenc -x`
# all commands following in the script will now have access to the env variables
```

## Comments

Anything following a `#` sign in the `.env` file,  is stripped. That means you can have full line comments:

```
# the whole line is a comments because it start with a "#"
```

or inline comments:

```
VAR="a value" # text before the "#" is kept; text following the "#" is stripped
```
